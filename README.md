This is my attempt to build a site using new-to-me technologies that I will use to showcase my projects, interests, and thoughts.

## Tech 
I choose my tooling based on what appeals to me in terms of developer experience (DX) and visual styling.  I am in no way expert in any of these but I think this is the best way to practice.

I am building this site using the following tooling/frameworks:
* [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/)  - Universal Rendering mode
* [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/)
* [Nuxt Content](https://content.nuxt.com/)
* [Nuxt Image](https://image.nuxt.com/)
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) - Site hosting & image CDN

## Future Plans
* Implement basic Stripe integrations that also show both client & server side code snippets
* Continue to build out a more robust photo sharing system
* Implement a more fully featuring blog and blogging elements
